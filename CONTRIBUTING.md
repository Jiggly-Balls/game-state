## ‚úÖ Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Type annotations are required.
- Use docstrings in [Numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) style.
- Use `basedpyright` for type checking.
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- If you have `Make` on your system you can run `make` to autoformat and `make check` to type check (both through `uv`).

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Prefix with a verb if relevant (e.g., `Fix`, `Add`, `Refactor`, `Document`).

### Tests

- Use `pytest` for writing and running tests.
- Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- If additional dependencies are required for tests or the library, add them to `tests/requirements.txt`.
- Run the following command to run pytest-
  ```
  (.venv) $ pytest
  ```
