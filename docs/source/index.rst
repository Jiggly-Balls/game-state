Welcome to the Game-State Documentation!
========================================

This documentation will serve as an API reference as well as a guide to getting
started with the Game-State library.

About the Project
-----------------
Game State is a lightweight, framework-agnostic Python library for managing
game and application states in a clean, structured, and scalable way.

It provides a flexible state machine built around explicit lifecycle hooks,
making it easy to switch between screens such as menus, gameplay, pause states,
and overlays without tightly coupling your logic to a specific rendering or
event framework.
